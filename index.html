<div class="services">
	<h2>Services</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Essay Writing:</h3><br>One of the core parts of a college application is your essay or personal statement. It is the only way that the recruiters have to get to know you as a person. So writing a strong, personable, and unique essay should be every student’s goal, and I am hoping to help you with that essay-writing process</li>
		<li><h3>Resume Building:</h3><br>
            As you transition into higher studies, it is important to start building a resume that highlights your academic achievements in a professional manner. A resume should be short but impactful, and with some guidance you can build a polished resume for career opportunities.</li>

            SAT, ACT, and TOEFL are some of the main exams that I tutor for.</li>
